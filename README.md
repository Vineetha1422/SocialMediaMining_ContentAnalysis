# Analyzing Public Reactions to AI Copyright Issues

## Overview
This project analyzes public sentiment regarding copyright challenges posed by generative AI systems like DALL-E and Midjourney. With the U.S. Copyright Office receiving 10,000 formal responses but limited insight into broader public opinion, this study examines 50 Twitter/X comments to identify key themes in the AI copyright debate. The research addresses urgent questions about intellectual property rights, ethical AI training practices, and economic impacts on creators[1][2].

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered tweets using `#AIcopyright` and keyword combinations ("GenerativeAI copyright", "AIart infringement") from July 30-September 30, 2023[1][2]
2. **Coding Framework**: Developed iterative codebook with 4 main categories:
   - Ownership (28% of comments)
   - Legal Implications (14%)
   - Ethical Concerns (42%)
   - Economic Impact (16%)
3. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identified 5 participant types (Artists, Authors, Creators, etc.)
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorized responses as Pro-AI (20%), Neutral (22%), or Anti-AI (58%)

## Key Results
- **Dominant Concern**: 42% focused on ethical issues of unlicensed training data[1][2]
- **Creator Sentiment**: 58% opposition from artists/authors citing exploitation risks
- **Pro-AI Arguments**: Focused on ownership models (60% of supportive comments)
- **Legal Uncertainty**: 57% of neutral comments discussed regulatory gaps
